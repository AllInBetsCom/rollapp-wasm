# State

## State Objects

The `x/gasless` module keeps the following objects in the state: GasTank, GasConsumer and TxGTIDs. 

These objects are used to store the state of a 
- `GasTanks` - to store the configurations and tank status.
- `GasConsumer` - to track the number of times a wallet has interacted with the whitelisted txs and fee usage from the gas tank
- `TxGTIDs` - mapping for messgae types or contract address with the gas tank ids whitelisted them.

```go
// this defines the configuration of the gas tank with reserve address, status of tank and other basic configs.
message GasTank {
    // id of the gas tank
    uint64 id = 1;

    // creator of the gas tank
    string provider = 2;

    // reserve address for fund storage for gas tank
    string reserve = 3;

    // status of the gas tank 
    bool is_active = 4;

    // maximum number of txs a wallet can make
    uint64 max_txs_count_per_consumer = 5;

    // maximum fee a wallet can utilize from this tank in the lifetime
    string max_fee_usage_per_consumer = 6 [(gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int", (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
    
    // maximum fee a tank can supply for each tx.
    string max_fee_usage_per_tx = 7 [(gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int", (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
    
    // MessageTypes allowed to consume gas from this tank
    repeated string txs_allowed = 8;

    // contracat addresses allowed to consume gas from this tank
    repeated string contracts_allowed = 9;

    // wallet address that can manage blocking/unblocking of consumer on owners behalf
    repeated string authorized_actors = 10;
    
    // fee denom of the tx supported by the gas tank
    string fee_denom = 11;
}
```


```go
message UsageDetail {
    google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 1 [(gogoproto.stdtime) = true, (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
    string gas_consumed = 2 [(gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int", (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}

message UsageDetails {
    string usage_identifier = 1;
    repeated UsageDetail details = 2;
}

message Usage {
    repeated UsageDetails txs = 1;
    repeated UsageDetails contracts = 2;
}

message ConsumptionDetail {
    uint64 gas_tank_id = 1;
    bool is_blocked = 2;
    uint64 total_txs_allowed = 3;
    uint64 total_txs_made = 4;
    string total_fee_consumption_allowed = 5 [(gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int", (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
    string total_fees_consumed = 6 [(gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int", (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
    Usage usage = 7;
}

message GasConsumer {
    // wallet address of the user
    string consumer = 1;

    //consumtion history of the user
    repeated ConsumptionDetail consumptions = 2;
}
```


```go
message TxGTIDs {
    // messsage type of contract address
    string tx_path_or_contract_address = 1;
    
    // all the gas tanks ids who has whitelisted this message type or contract address
    repeated uint64 gas_tank_ids = 2;
}
```


## Genesis & Params

The `x/gasless` module's `GenesisState` defines the state necessary for initializing the chain from a previously exported height. It contains the module Parameters,GasTank mapping, GasTanks and GasConsumers. The params are used to control the tank creation limit, deposits and fee burning ratio. This value can be modified with a governance proposal.

```go
// GenesisState defines the gasless module's genesis state.
message GenesisState {
  Params params = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  repeated TxGTIDs tx_to_gas_tank_ids = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  uint64 last_gas_tank_id = 3;
  repeated GasTank gas_tanks = 4 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  repeated GasConsumer gas_consumers = 5 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}
```

```go
// Params defines the parameters for the module.
message Params {
    // maximum tanks a wallet can create
    uint64 tank_creation_limit = 1;

    // minimum deposit require while creating gas tank.
    repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin minimum_gas_deposit = 2
      [(gogoproto.castrepeated) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Coins", (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
    
    // the fee burning percentage received from the tx ( default 0% )
    string fee_burning_percentage = 3 [(gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int", (gogoproto.nullable) = false];  
}
```



## State Transitions

The following state transitions are possible:

- Creating a gas tank creates GasTank object in the state, also creates or updates a mapping of gas tank id in the state.
- Authorizing actor updates the existing gas tank in the state
- Updating a gas tank status updates the existing gas tank in the state
- Updating a gas tank config updates the existing gas tank in the state
- Blocking a consumer updates the GasConsumer state
- Unblocking a consumer updates the GasConsumer state
- Updatig consumer limit updates the GasConsumer state
